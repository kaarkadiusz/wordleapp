## WordleGame
This repo implements Wordle game using Next.js.
Run development server using `npm run dev` or visit [this site](https://kaarkadiuszwordleapp.netlify.app/) hosted on Netlify.

**Disclaimer:**
The polish wordset was generated using [sjp.pl](https://sjp.pl/sl/odmiany/) resources.
The english wordset was generated using [this repo](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).
The wordsets are pulled up straight from dictionaries, which I haven't filtered, so they are bound to have a lot of uncommon words.
